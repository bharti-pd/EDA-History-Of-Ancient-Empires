# History-Of-Ancient-Empires-EDA
The Axial Age dataset tracks a variety of sociopolitical norms and their development across key areas in Afro-Eurasia. The specific scores for each sociopolitical norm for each date (varying time spans between 5300 BCE and 1800 CE in 100 year increments) within 10 NGAs (natural geographic area) were agreed-upon by a group of experts and compiled into the dataset.

## So What Was the Axial Age?¶
The Axial Age (also known as the Axis Age) is the era when the great intellectual, philosophical, and religious systems that came to form subsequent human civilization and culture appeared, much of the inhabited world at about the same time. The period during which most of the main religious and spiritual traditions emerged.

## Dataset

For the analysis, I have used a relatively very small dataset, Axial Age Dataset, by Seshat: Global History Databank, "a large, multidisciplinary team of evolutionary scientists, historians, anthropologists, archaeologists, economists, and other social scientists from around the world."

This research employed data from the Seshat Databank (seshatdatabank.info) under Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial (CC By-NC SA) licensing.

This dataset contains a lot of missing values. So I have first visualised the missing values and then I have done data cleaning. After which, I have performed data visualization.
